A total of 8 parameters and projections of 17 climate indices representing extreme conditions were selected in river basin scales in the whole country through model simulation, and the differences of the studied parameters until 2010 were calculated as seasonal and annual averages for 10 and 30-year periods based on the reference period accepted as the simulations of 1971-2000. 3 global climate model results with 10x10 km resolution were obtained for Turkey for the first time in this project.<br><br>Within the scope of the hydrologic projections, the second stage of the projection studies, the water potentials of all river basins in Turkey were calculated for the first time using the hydrologic model. The precipitation values were converted to river flow values by running hydrologic models with the outcomes of the climate models, and water potential modelling/ calculation study was conducted by taking into account the current situation of surface water and groundwater sources in all river basins and the estimated situation for projected periods.</div></div>

In regional climate projections produced by the TSMS using the downscaling method, it is based on the global models prepared by 20 climate modeling groups, members of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), within the scope of the Coupled Model Intercomparing.<br><br>Project Phase 5, CMIP5, and new generation concentration scenarios used in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCP). Moderate radiative forcing (4.5W/m2) RCP4.5 scenarios and high radiative forcing (8.5W/m2) RCP8.5 scenarios were used for the years 2016-2099in the projection, and the climate projection model HadGEM2-ES developed by the Hadley Research Center of the UK Meteorological Office was produced by downscaling the global model results with the regional climate model system (The Regional Climate Model system, RegCM4).<br><br>The climate projections produced by the TSMS for a domain covering Turkey and its vicinity will be discussed in this section. Projections were produced based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The scenarios used are also the most preferred scenarios in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report. The 1971-2000 period was selected as the reference period for the projections produced in 20 km resolution, and the years 2016-2099 were selected for the projections. The 2016-2099 projection range was studied in periods of 2016-2040, 2041-2070, 2071-2099.<br><br>The temperature averages of global models that were used within the scope of the CMIP5 on Turkey were compared to produce high-resolution regional projections for Turkey and its vicinity and to see the general characteristics of models’ climate change projections.<br><br>According to the average temperature comparison results of the global climate models for Turkey and its vicinity, it is observed that HadGEM, GFDL, and MPI global models are among the models that ideally represent the average temperature values in Turkey. According to the results of HadGEM, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI) global model data used by the TSMS, the average temperatures achieved as a result of regional climate projections are consistent with global models (Turkish State Meteorological Service, 2015). Therefore, HadGEM, GFDL, and MPI global models were preferred in the TSMS’s studies to produce regional climate projections. In the evaluation, it is observed that the coldest model is INMCM4 and the warmest model is MIROC for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5.<br><br>As a result of the comparisons and investigations performed, the outcomes of 3 of the global models that produced appropriate results for Turkey and its vicinityunder CMIP5 (HadGEM2-ES, MPIESM-MR, and GFDL-ESM2M) were selected. Regional climate projections were obtained by using the downscaling method through these 3 models RegCM4 regional climate model. The TSMS produces results with 20 km resolution using the results of the global model HadGEM with 112.5 km resolution in the RegCM model.<br><br>Testing (parametrization) of the model is extremely important in terms of reflecting the observed climatic values closest in each grid. For example, humidity and temperature values in each grid affect the cloud formation, and the amounts of aerosol affect the amount of precipitation. Therefore, the result of a well-parameterized model will help decision-makers to take decisions on adaptation activities for climate change. For this purpose, parametrization tests were first performed by the TSMS, and then the model was run by selecting 4 different periods. The regional model takes the initial and boundary conditions from the global model and provides a transition from the low-resolution topography of the global model to a more detailed topography of the regional model. The region located between 27.00°-51.00° North latitudes and 5.00°-55.00° east longitudes was selected as the domain where the models would be run, in order to encompass the movement paths of air masses that affect Turkey. The first 3 grids in all directions (east, west, north, south) of the domain area were not taken into consideration to ignorethe regional climate model boundary conditions errors.</div></div>

The most noticeable consequences are warmer winters, drier and hotter summers, changes in biodiversity, and retreat of glaciers in the mountains. Climate change has impact on terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems and increases the overall strain on the environment. Social and economic losses caused by weather and climate-related extreme events and disasters have been increasing along with a significant spatial and inter-annual variability in Turkey. The nature, intensity and impact power of extreme weather and climate events and disasters closely depend on economic, social, geographical, demographic, cultural, institutional and governance, environmental and ecological factors, as well as exposure (aspect) and vulnerability levels varying at spatial and temporal scales. The climate of Turkey is expected to undergo significant changes over the coming decades.</div></div>
