The topography is determined by the Central Plateau, the Jura mountains and the Alps. About half of Switzerland’s surface area is located above 1,000 metres above sea level.<br><br>With the Alps acting as climatic divide, meteorological conditions such as average temperature and precipitation vary significantly across Switzerland. Variable winter temperatures are an important factor influencing energy consumption for heating and leave a strong imprint on annual CO2 emissions. Long-term measurements indicate a marked shift towards a warmer climate (increase of the mean temperature by more than two degrees Celsius between 1864 and 2020, i.e. about twice the increase of the global mean temperature). Changes in mean precipitation are less clear, although there are robust indications for an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation. Various climate indices document the ongoing climate change in Switzerland. For instance, over the Central Plateau, the average number of summer days has more than doubled over the last 60 years, the number of heating degree days has decreased by about 15 to 20 per cent in the same time period, the number of snow days has decreased and the number of sunny days has increased.</div>

Population is concentrated on the Central Plateau, the major alpine valleys and the Ticino, while the density is substantially lower in the hilly and alpine regions of the country. Population growth has been stable at around 0.75 per cent per year during the last years and mainly results from immigration and increasing life expectancy. It is expected that population growth will continue in the future, leading to 10.44 million permanent residents by 2050. Approximately 25.5 per cent of the permanent residential population are foreign nationals.</div>

With just a few exceptions in the early 1990s, in 2009 and in 2020, Switzerland’s real gross domestic product increased annually by up to four per cent compared to the previous year over the period 1990 to 2020. Switzerland’s economy largely depends on the services sector, which in 2020 not only employed 76.4 per cent of the total workforce, but also contributed 73.3 per cent to the gross value added. The economy strongly depends on trade with other countries, as Switzerland imports bulk raw materials and exports processed high-quality goods. Switzerland’s trade balance (exports minus imports) was about balanced between 1992 and the early 2000s. Since 2002, exports growth has been accelerating as compared to imports growth. During the last years, Switzerland’s trade balance has remained between about four and five per cent of the gross domestic product. Among the most important traded goods in terms of monetary value are chemical and pharmaceutical products, noble metals, jewels and gemstones, machines, instruments and electronics, watches and precision instruments.</div>

In order to be able to calculate future changes in temperature, precipitation and other parameters, assumptions must be made about future global greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, so-called emission scenarios are defined on the basis of a number of assumptions about population growth, possible technological advancements and global political decisions. Climate change scenarios can therefore not be considered as predictions. Rather, they indicate the possible consequences for the climate if the greenhouse gas emissions rise unchecked or are, on the other hand, reduced.</div>

According to Article 8, the Swiss federation shall coordinate and provide the basis for adaptation measures. Coordinating body is the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN). For the implementation of the legal mandate, the FOEN developed an adaptation strategy together with federal offices from other ministries.<br><br>With the 2012 Strategy for Adaptation to Climate Change in Switzerland, the Federal Council created a framework for a coordinated approach to adaptation to the impacts of climate change. The strategy contains the goals for adaptation, describes the greatest challenges and prioritises the fields of action for adaptation at federal level. A first action plan was adopted for the periode 2014-2019 by federal council. It included 63 adaptation measures. Currently, the second action plan regulates the implementation in the years 2020-2025. The Action Plan 2020-2025 comprises 75 measures at federal level. 63 of these measures are activities in the sectors of water management, dealing with natural hazards, soil protection, agriculture, forestry, energy, housing, tourism, biodiversity management, health (human and animal) and spatial development. 12 measures are cross-sectoral in nature. They aim to improve the knowledge base, transfer knowledge, coordinate and promote the implementation of the adaptation strategy.<br><br>In a referendum vote on 18 June 2023, the Swiss voting polulation approved a new climate law (Bundesgesetz über die Ziele im Klimaschutz, die Innovation und die Stärkung der Energiesicherheit). With the entry into force of the new law on 01.01.2025, the legal mandate for adaptation in Switzerland will be strengthened: the Confederation and the cantons will receive the mandate to take measures to protect against and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change within the scope of their competences.</div>
