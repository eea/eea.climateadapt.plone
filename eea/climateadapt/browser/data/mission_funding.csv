If they are well insulated and
and use renewable energy sources, we can also ensure the energy security of our children and grandchildren for generations to come.
for our future generations. This call for proposals under the Operational Programme for Environment and Energy Efficiency will help us to do this.
This is the first call for proposals for a new Energy Efficiency Directive, amending Directives 2009/125/EC and 2010/30/EU and Directive 2004/8/EC
Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council repealing Directives 2004/10/EC and 2006/32/EC
Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (hereafter Directive 2012/27/EU) requires EU Member States to
achieve new energy savings of at least 0.8 percent of their final energy consumption
per year averaged over the three years preceding 1 January 2019.
The strategic documents adopted by the Government in January 2020 (National Energy Strategy 2030,
outlook to 2040 <new NES> and the National Energy and Climate Plan <NEKT>).
energy efficiency target for 2030 is that the country's final energy consumption should not exceed
(785 PJ). If final energy consumption increases above 2005 levels, the
increase can only come from carbon neutral energy sources.
In line with national and EU strategy, the main objective of this Call is to encourage
energy efficiency improvements and to promote the use of decentralised, environmentally friendly renewable energy sources.
renewable energy systems. The aim of increasing energy efficiency and
energy efficiency and energy saving is underlined by the fact that, according to statistics, the domestic
energy intensity per unit of GDP is more than three times higher in terms of currency parity,
three times higher than in developed EU Member States in purchasing power parity terms. Present
This call for proposals contributes to improving the energy efficiency of buildings and the use of renewable energy
investments to improve energy efficiency in buildings and to increase the use of renewable energy sources.",0,Hungarian Government,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
