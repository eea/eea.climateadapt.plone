    marked requests (checking presence of special access token), so it doesn't
    interfere for the rest of the site.

    The CityProfile model class has a special implementation of
    __ac_local_roles__ that can authenticate the token against that CityProfile
    and grant this anonymous user the Owner role.

    Then the rest of the permissions problem is solved with the help of
    workflow.

    The CityMayor role is used to allow adding content to the /city-profile
    folder.

    This plugin also implements enumerateUsers, to be able to provide
    information on the CityMayor user
