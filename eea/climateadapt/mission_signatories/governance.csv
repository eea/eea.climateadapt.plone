The works carried out for vulnerable groups with our understanding of social municipality are listed below. • Free or discounted card application services are offered to our elderly, disabled, mother and student citizens in order to increase their integration into sustainable transportation.• The number of female personnel working within the scope of observing gender equality increased from 15% to 19.08% under the roof of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.• Considering the green employment approach, 26 regional employment offices were established and as of June 2023, we helped 120 thousand Istanbulites find a job.• Producing high quality and affordable bread, Istanbul Halk Ekmek serves especially our low-income citizens.• 75 kindergartens have been opened within the scope of the “Yuvam Istanbul” project for children, one of the vulnerable groups.","While preparing the Istanbul Climate Action Plan, opinions and suggestions were received from all Istanbul stakeholders. This is important for the inclusiveness and transparency of the climate action plan. At the same time, meetings with the officials of 39 district municipalities within the borders of Istanbul are actively carried out in the preparation of the action plan and in the current projects.In addition, \'Participatory Budget\' project has been provided to Istanbul citizens. Through Participatory Budget, our citizens have been asked about their opinions and suggests regarding climate change related issues. On the other hand, \'Climate Platform\' has been found consisting of academicians, Non-Governmental organizations, climate activists and Istanbul citizens. Routine meetings were held on the Climate Platform by providing a discussion environment on the existing barriers, solution suggestions and good practice examples regarding greenhouse gas emission reduction and climate change adaptation actions such as water stress, drought, green space management, biodiversity, integrated transportation systems and renewable energy technologies.As Istanbul, we have ambitious goals to become a carbon neutral and resilient city. In order to achieve these goals, we carry out the following activities:- 100 Carbon Neutral and Smart Cities MissionThe mission's purpose is to support 100 (100+12) European cities to achieve the goal of climate neutrality by 2030. All cities participating in this project are intended to become centres for innovation and experimentation and to serve as examples for all other cities. - Call for Pilot CitiesNetZeroCities has published a call for pilot Cities. Under this initiative, which is part of the Climate Neutral and Smart Cities Mission, 30 pilot cities will be selected among European cities which submit innovative projects on how to achieve carbon neutrality until the year 2030.According to Istanbul's greenhouse gas emission inventory, stationary energy contributes the highest percentage (64%). The project therefore supports action on energy used in buildings in the city. For this purpose, guidelines will be established for green and carbon neutral buildings which are to be renovated in the context of urban regeneration. The project uses sensors to monitor energy consumption in residential buildings in selected pilot regions. Within the scope of the project, the residential area where the sensors to monitor the energy efficiency will be installed has been determined. Methodologies have been developed for data collection. Based on the data a change in behaviour towards more efficient energy use will be promoted. - Adaptation MissionIstanbul has entitled to become one of 215 signators of the EU Adaptation Mission which was initiated to support cities in their efforts to become resilient to climate change by 2030. The purpose of the Adaptation Mission is to prepare cities/regions for the current as well as future effects of climate change and to mobilise them to ensure adaptation. By this mission it will be possible to generate common benefits for municipalities working for the same goal, to test innovative solutions and to offer financial resources for future joint activities."
France,31175,"Prior to the adoption of the 2018 Climate Action Plan, the city of Paris has conducted a study to assess the socio-economic impacts of the energy and climate transition. The study analyzed a range of individual, economic, social, and political impacts resulting from the key actions outlined in the Climate Plan. It also examined their effects on employment, well-being, equity, and overall balance across the city. The findings of the study revealed that many measures implemented under the Paris Climate Plan will contribute to enhancing the well-being of citizens by improving the quality of their immediate environment. This, in turn, is expected to have positive impacts on both physical and psychological health. These improvements are likely to foster support for the Climate Plan among citizens and increase their willingness to actively contribute to its success. Additionally, the City of Paris conducted in 2021 a resilience and vulnerability diagnosis in the context of climate disruption, using the latest scientific climate change models. Lastly, the City of Paris is working to Identify areas of environmental health fragility. The findings of this assessment provide support for the policies outlined in the Paris Climate Plan, particularly in terms of adaptation measures. These include greening the city, strengthening water management strategies, promoting solidarity towards vulnerable populations, and controlling water consumption.In Attached: ParisInTheFaceOfClimateChange [EN]The city regularly conducts city-wide studies on various equity-related topics such as: Update demographic, economic and social data for Paris, to understand gender gaps and trends.In Attached: Gender inequality in Paris [FR]Report on the implementation of actions in working-class neighbourhoods. In 2021, an analysis was carried out and confirmed the narrowing of certain social gaps between the population of those neighbourhoods and that of Paris over the recent period (social indicators, educational success, economic dynamism, living environment), while at the same time indicators of precariousness remain high and gaps in employment and professional integration persist. The workshops also highlighted a number of issues that are becoming increasingly important in working-class neighbourhoods, including environmental health.In Attached: The frame of reference for evaluating the 2015-2022 Paris City Contract [FR]Quantification of jobs linked to the circular economy in Paris.Circular economy helps combat climate change by reducing CO2 emissions from economic activities. It goes hand in hand with the development of new modes of production and consumption, generating new activities and creating sustainable jobs that cannot be relocated. That's why the job creation made possible by the development of the circular economy in Paris, and the resulting creation of value, have been defined as monitoring indicators for the Paris Circular Economy Plan. The quantification of jobs linked to the circular economy in Paris (document to be consulted as an attachment to the response) makes it possible to estimate the number of jobs in Paris at 66,500 FTE (full-time equivalent) in 2016. They represent 2.9% of Parisian jobs and generate an annual added value of 7 billion euros.In Attached: Circular Economy Quantifying jobs [FR]Since the adoption in 2016 of the Paris Environmental Health Plan, Health Impact Assessments (HIA) have been made. HIA is a science-based decision-making process that incorporates participatory approaches whenever possible. It helps contextualize research data and facilitates the implementation of projects by enhancing their legitimacy and social acceptability. HIA allows all stakeholders involved in a policy or project to address the social, economic, and environmental issues that may impact health and well-being. The main objective is to take into account health issues in the new urbanism projects, directly from the inhabitants, theirs needs and habits.","Ensure “Access to energy for all”: The Energy poverty program (2022-2026)In 2023, a Local Intervention Service for Energy Management and a €400,000 fund to help with minor repairs is now offered. The SLIME program aims to scale up the identification, guidance, and support for households facing energy precariousness. Within this framework, 1,200 home visits are scheduled by 2025 to carry out energy diagnostics and provide long-term support, as well as distributing emergency kits. Since September 2022, 152 reports have been recorded: 24% are eligible for SLIME, 46% concern social housing provided by the City, 12% involve other landlords, and 18% will not be directed towards a diagnostic assessment (income above the threshold, opting out, alternative renovation process, etc.).Supporting the most vulnerable with REFLEX: “Reflex” is a personalized assistance tool and support system for the most vulnerable Parisians during the hot summer months. Elderly, sick or isolated people can sign up to this file. If the Heatwave Plan is triggered, those registered are contacted by telephone to check on their state of health, and to consider providing assistance if necessary. Today, more than 10,000 people registered in this file and benefit from personalized assistance in the event of extreme heat. You can register yourself or, with their consent, people you know. In 2022, all Reflex registrants been called, and 158 home visits were organized.Reinforcing actions for people in precarious situations: The Paris Solidarity Guide Summer 2023 caters to the needs of vulnerable and homeless individuals during the summer. It provides a comprehensive list of available assistance. Street outreach activities are intensified, including the distribution of water bottles from Eau de Paris, refillable at any of the 1,200 drinking fountains in the city. Additionally, the inaugural summer edition of the Night of Solidarity took place on june 27. A total of 817 individuals were identified as homeless, compared to 707 in the same three districts in January, representing a 15.5% increase. However, this significant rise should be approached with caution due to the absence of comparative data from previous summers. Additionally, the results obtained in the 8th, 12th, and 20th districts cannot be extrapolated to the entire territory of Paris. After analyzing all questionnaires in September, a more precise overview of the current situation and encountered profiles will be provided. Among the initial findings, a decrease in the number of homeless families and couples is notable. Only 5.5% of the counted individuals were in such situations within the three tested districts, compared to 19% in January.https://www.paris.fr/pages/le-guide-solidarite-a-paris-ete-2023-est-disponible-23880https://www.paris.fr/pages/nuit-de-la-solidarite-ete-2023-23860Oasis schoolyards, creating inclusive and refreshing spaces for all: Parisian school playgrounds are being transformed into \'oases\' to enhance daily livability and inclusivity.

As part of the agreement, the city has pledged to retrofit 200 single-family buildings in the city by the end of 2024. As part of the programme's implementation to date, the city is carrying out an inventory of single-family buildings of potential programme beneficiaries among Warsaw residents. This mainly concerns people who are poor and have coal-fired heating sources, who have been identified by Social Welfare Centres, and people who have applied for a city grant for replacing heat sources but have given up due to a lack of funds for their own contribution (despite a high % subsidy from the city). Regulations have been adopted to define the rules for implementing the program and carrying out the first retrofits. Warsaw is one of the few cities in the world to receive financial support from a new Inclusive Climate Action Cities Fund. The ICA is managed by C40 Cities, a global network of cities working together to tackle the climate crisis. Warsaw (as a member of C40) was selected to participate in the project through a rigorous process and will benefit from the first round of disbursements from the ICA fund. Each city received a grant (of up to USD 60 000) to implement projects that remove specific socio-economic barriers to accelerate climate action that is equitable, inclusive and benefits all residents, especially communities vulnerable to global warming. Warsaw addressed the energy poverty of low-income groups through the Carbon-neutral and Affordable Retrofits for Everyone in Need (CARE) project. The aim of the project was to specifically care for energy-poor residents and increase the energy efficiency of municipal housing. CARE project lasted from 07.2023 to 06.2024. The project developed a database of municipal buildings in the city, using data from various public sector resources.It will collect data in three thematic groups: - Energy classes of buildings; - Heat sources; - Social criteria, important in terms of exposure to fuel poverty. Data from the database allowed the preparation of an algorithm that will identify buildings whose inhabitants are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of fuel poverty. This tool will support the process of thermal modernisation of Warsaw and the fight against energy poverty by objectively identifying municipal buildings in which thermal modernisation and renovation measures should be carried out first. In addition, the data will indicate the places where the effect of measures will bring the greatest benefits both to the city and its inhabitants."

Finland,50154,"City of Turku is chairing the Turku Region Air Protection Co-operative Group. The group consists of the environmental authorities of the region, together with 11 industrial partners encompassing the energy industry, shipyards, harbors, the building materials industry and others. Turku is monitoring ambient air quality at seven monitoring stations in the region. The emissions of air pollutants have decreased substantially with the emissions of greenhouse gases. In 2023, ambient air quality, as determined by the national 24-hour air quality index, was most commonly classified as good or satisfactory. Limit values were not exceeded.\n\nThe baseline assessment study for the Circular Turku Roadmap identified more than 700 circular economy stakeholders, 270 of which were businesses engaged in circular economy. Many significant regional solutions that follow circular economy principles have already been implemented in energy production, water systems, waste management and industry development.\n\nTurku has been developing climate budgeting for preparation, steering and monitoring its investments. In climate budgeting, the EU taxonomy classification of sustainable funding has been used as the framework for assessing the climate impacts of investments, which enables a multidimensional examination of environmental objectives and, for example, the utilization of green funding. In addition to climate change mitigation and adaptation, the approach incorporates objectives for water and marine resources, circular economy, pollution prevention, and biodiversity. We collaborate closely with the scientific community in providing knowledge about climate related health risks and their linkage to nature-based solutions and social equity. For example, in the Hercules project environmental and socio-economic parameters have been analyzed together with cohort health data on several time-steps in the largest cities of Finland. In many studies higher greenness has been associated with higher levels of physical activity. Importantly, the association between higher greenness and higher level of physical activity is stronger in the more disadvantaged areas. The studies have also shown an inverse association between residential greenness and depression, implying lowered depression risk for individuals with higher residential greenness.\n\nWe have also studied the evolution of spatial temperature differences during a 17 year period in Turku. The Urban Heat Island intensity showed a slight intensifying trend. Relative cooling of daytime temperatures was also detected at some observation sites e.g. as a consequence of forest growth and related micro-climatological change. Thus vegetation is a valuable measure to mitigate the Urban Heat Island effect and to reduce heat related mortality also in higher latitudes.","In addition to above, Turku is a partner in several projects dealing with these issues. For example, in Coevolvers we are exploring how nature-based solutions (NBS) can contribute to the societal change needed to address the ongoing biodiversity and climate crisis. We are working on co-designing fair NBS governance techniques, models, and practices that are fair for humans (especially for vulnerable people) and non-humans."

Este Plano é composto por um conjunto de medidas de ação que pretendem proteger e salvaguardar estes consumidores do risco de pobreza energética. \nO instrumento debruça a sua ação sobre 4 eixos: habitação, acesso a serviços de energia, implementação de uma ação territorial integrada e a aposta no conhecimento como forma de informar para o processo de decisão. As várias medidas pretendem: (I) aumentar o conforto térmico das residências, diminuir consumos energéticos através da promoção da eficiência energética, promover a produção de energia renovável,(II) assegurar o acesso ininterrupto a serviços de energia, (III) reforçar a ação das estruturas locais no combate à pobreza energética e (IV) capacitar os atores locais, aumentar a literacia energética de diferentes públicos-alvo, estimular a investigação e robustecer a oferta formativa em domínios deste compto. \nPara apoiar diretamente os cidadãos a implementar medidas de eficiência energética nas suas habitações e melhorar as suas condições de habitabilidade, Matosinhos disponibiliza, desde novembro de 2022, um balcão único (one-stop-shop) digital e físico denominado Matosinhos Energy Hub. Este balcão, desenvolvido no âmbito do projeto Porto Energy ElevatoR (PEER), financiado pelo programa Horizonte 2020 e coordenado pela Agência de Energia do Porto, compreende o aconselhamento acerca de soluções de eficiência energética e de energias renováveis, legislação aplicável, identificação de oportunidades e apoio a candidaturas para financiamento. É um exemplo concreto da atuação do Município de Matosinhos em prol da garantia da equidade e inclusividade nas políticas em prol do clima. No ano de 2023, foram feitos 49 pedidos de avaliação de potencial (inquéritos respondidos) e 41 atendimentos técnicos.\nTambém o projeto ATELIER que tem como objetivo contribuir para o desenho de cidades inteligentes, energeticamente eficientes, com planos de mobilidade sustentável e com integração de soluções de produção de energia renovável é desenvolvido numa área de intervenção com populações mais vulneráveis. Este projeto atua sobre o Conjunto Habitacional de Custió (Bairro Social) e estende-se ao troço do Rio Leça entre a Ponte da Pedra e a Ponte do Carro. \nA participação no ATELIER complementa as ações iniciadas em 2018 no Living Lab de Matosinhos, um projeto financiado pelo Fundo Ambiental, no qual foram desenvolvidas um conjunto de iniciativas de cocriação e inovação aberta com o objetivo de desenvolvimento de um espaço de teste, experimentação, e demonstração, em contexto real, de soluções tecnológicas, organizacionais e sociais integradas na intersecção entre mobilidade, energia, ambiente, edifícios e conectividade orientadas para a descarbonização da cidade. \nOutro exemplo pode ser dado através do projeto PROLIGHT. Um dos objetivos deste projeto compreende a implementação de uma solução de produção de energia renovável, através da implementação de painéis fotovoltaicos no Bairro de Carcavelos, com o objetivo final de poder dar origem a uma comunidade de energia renovável. Pretende-se através do envolvimento da comunidade e do desenvolvimento dos investimentos necessários poder beneficiar a população vulnerável deste Bairro, disponibilizando energia renovável a custos mais acessíveis. É também uma maneira de combate à pobreza energética desta comunidade. \nO próprio Laboratório de Cidadani"

In Tampere, we have understood that achieving climate neutrality by 2030, and ensuring a just and inclusive urban climate transition, requires new ways of engaging citizens and making their sustainable choices as easy as possible. The transition must be socially justifiable and meaningful to people. By 2030, everyone in Tampere has to be able to live a climate resilient lifestyle and make climate friendly choices best suited for oneself, regardless of one's socioeconomic situation, neighbourhood, age, gender or health. This requires strengthening of cultural sustainability of our climate action. It means keeping everyone on board and working seriously towards cohesive and sustainable communities and the social and ecological change. To ensure this a new 4-year development program Climate Neutral Actions was established in 2022,. The program concentrates on enabling behavioural change of citizens, especially in terms of their mobility and consumption. In addition, the program focuses on enhancing circular economy especially with the private sector, and furthermore coordinates and monitors city's own climate and environmental work, including biodiversity. The methods of the program are heavily focused on co-creation and empowerment. As a result, we will have climate actions tailored for specific city areas and groups of people, actions that actually are feasible for them in terms of their life situation and living location. As examples of our past actions, we have organised climate hero campaigns where citizens could share their favourite climate actions and calculate their carbon footprint. The city has also hosted Eco Impact dialogues for people to chat, share ideas, and get inspired. In another campaign the carbon footprint of four households was calculated and actions by which the household would achieve a so-called 1.5-degree life by 2030, were planned. Additionally, Tampere empowers its citizen by participatory budgeting, My2050 climate mobile game, and mobility carbon footprint calculator.Tampere has a continuous tradition of sustainability and climate work since first citizen engagement actions in 1990s. The climate neutrality goal has been explicitly stated in the city strategies and mayoral programs since 2017. We have separate councils for example for youth, elderly and disabled citizens. Citizens are also involved to the city planning process. People-centred housing, sustainable mobility, smart energy systems, circular economy and green and blue infrastructure, as well as co-creation with citizens, are at the core of our flagship urban investments, such as the new Hiedanranta city district. We also use data- and AI-driven solutions to develop smarter and more sustainable urban infrastructure and public services. Our annual climate budget is an important climate governance and transparency tool, which as part of the official financial statements makes visible the progress towards climate neutrality and the financial resources allocated for the measures. Achieving the above climate vision requires a change in our ways of doing and thinking in all spheres of urban development and urban life, and determination for working together. Citizen empowerment, humancentered actions and co-creation are at the core of our climate policy and all related actions. We are cocreating a climate neutral city and a just and resilient urban future for Tampere together with our citizens, communities, universities and companies."

France,54419,"An SDG analysis is conducted by the city and the metropolis every year to evaluate their action on different aspects. The latest one was carried out in 2023 for 2022.Climate actions have benefits on :\n- Human health : improvement of air quality, less noise, adaptation to heat waves, following of invasive species like the tiger mosquito, etc. It is followed by a local contract for health for the metropolitan region.\n- The protection of biodiversity and endemic species. Renaturation and greening of the city makes it also less hot during the summer and improves life quality. This also helps to improve water infiltration in the area, thereby reducing the risk of flooding.\n- Economy : some sectors need major changes in strategy to adapt themselves to climate change, like construction, and can thus create new employment. The shift towards low carbon economy can attract new investments to the territory. The economics network is encouraged to shift towards low-carbon economy, and the city and the metropolis provide some guidance and events for them to share good practice. The Interreg project Clim'Ability Care provides a framework for companies to share and improve their practices for adapting to climate change and has also turned into an interesting opportunity to foster transnational cooperation regarding adaptation solutions. \n- Social justice: climate action needs to be conducted to maintain social justice. Putting in place adaptation solutions is important to ensure the most vulnerable inhabitants are as protected as the most privileged ones. Then, citizens are invited to participate in decisions-making process to make them less difficult to accept. The most vulnerable inhabitants are helped financially and free counselling is provided by the Climate Agency.","Besides the actions that are led internally, the city finances the Climate Agency which provides counselling to citizens on how to decarbonate their means of transportation, or renovate their houses or apartments. The city also offers financial help for poorer citizens to change their means of transport so that it fits with the new regulation of the low emission zone. The heat wave plan tackles specific population that are more vulnerable. The adaptation strategy seeks to ensure that every inhabitant in the city can have access to nature. Reduction of energy poverty is a priority for the city, which helps poorer households to renovate their houses. The Citizen Participation Department also makes sure that no one is left behind, by ensuring that public policies are decided in collaboration with citizens, in a spirit of diversity and inclusiveness. The CODEV (a citizen body) is consulted on a wide range of socio-climatic issues. Finally, the Independent Observatory of Citizen Participation (created in 2023), an all-citizen body made up of representative panel of 20 citizens of Strasbourg for a one-year term, is now dedicated to monitoring and exploring citizen participation within the city of Strasbourg. These multiple bodies ensure that the opinions of citizens are taken into account in the decision-making process and that climate action is distributed as fairly and inclusively as possible."

Portugal,55334,"Ao avaliar as ações climáticas, o Município identificou várias oportunidades e benefícios que se desdobram em diferentes áreas, conforme descrito a seguir.\nA ação climática em Braga oferece oportunidades significativas para o crescimento económico local. Investimentos em tecnologias limpas, como energias renováveis e eficiência energética, não apenas reduzem os custos operacionais para as empresas, mas também criam novos empregos e setores económicos. A promoção de indústrias verdes e a modernização de infraestruturas podem impulsionar a competitividade local, atraindo investidores e estimulando a inovação. Além disso, iniciativas que visam a transição para a mobilidade elétrica e a construção sustentável podem resultar em economias substanciais no consumo de energia e na dependência de combustíveis fósseis.\nUma das principais vantagens da ação climática é a melhoria da qualidade do ar. A redução das emissões de gases poluentes, através de políticas de mobilidade sustentável e da promoção de transportes públicos, tem um impacto direto na saúde pública. A diminuição da poluição do ar contribui para a redução de doenças respiratórias e cardiovasculares, resultando em menos custos para o sistema de saúde e um aumento da produtividade. Assim, as iniciativas climáticas não apenas promovem a saúde ambiental, mas também beneficiam o bem-estar geral da população.\nAs ações climáticas promovem a construção de comunidades mais resilientes. Ao implementar infraestruturas verdes, como parques, telhados verdes e sistemas de drenagem sustentável, Braga não só mitiga os efeitos das alterações climáticas, mas também melhora a sua capacidade de resposta a eventos climáticos extremos, como inundações e ondas de calor. Essa resiliência tem impactos positivos na segurança da comunidade, na proteção de bens e na minimização de perdas económicas durante crises climáticas.\nA ação climática também promove a coesão social e a inclusão. Projetos que envolvem a participação da comunidade e a colaboração entre diferentes setores podem fortalecer os laços sociais e aumentar a conscientização sobre questões ambientais. A promoção de iniciativas de mobilidade sustentável e de eficiência energética, com enfoque em grupos vulneráveis, garante que todas as camadas da sociedade se beneficiem das ações climáticas. Este enfoque inclusivo é essencial para criar uma cidade equitativa, onde todos têm acesso às oportunidades de desenvolvimento sustentável.\nBraga possui um rico património natural e cultural que pode ser valorizado através de ações climáticas. A proteção e a recuperação de ecossistemas locais, como zonas húmidas e áreas verdes, não só preservam a biodiversidade, mas também enriquecem o ambiente urbano, tornando a cidade mais atrativa para residentes e visitantes. Além disso, a promoção do turismo sustentável, centrado em experiências que valorizem o património natural e cultural, pode gerar receitas adicionais para a economia local.\nAs iniciativas climáticas oferecem uma oportunidade valiosa para a educação e a sensibilização ambiental. Programas de educação nas escolas e nas comunidades, focados em práticas sustentáveis e na importância da ação climática, ajudam a formar cidadãos mais conscientes e proativos. Ao promover uma cultura de sustentabilidade, o Município pode inspirar uma nova geração a tomar decisões informadas que beneficiem tanto o ambiente quanto a sociedade.\nA ação climática também pode estimular a inovação e a pesquisa. Braga tem a oportunidade de se tornar um laboratório vivo para tecnologias sustentáveis e soluções inovadoras. A colaboração com universidades, centros de pesquisa e empresas pode resultar em desenvolvimentos tecnológicos que não apenas beneficiam a cidade, mas também contribuem para o conhecimento global sobre práticas climáticas eficazes. A promoção de parcerias entre academia e setor privado pode acelerar a adoção de tecnologias limpas e soluções criativas para desafios urbanos.\n","O Município de Braga tem implementado várias ações concretas para assegurar a distribuição igualitária e inclusiva dos benefícios da ação climática. Essas iniciativas são projetadas para atender às necessidades de todos os segmentos da população, especialmente os grupos mais vulneráveis. Abaixo estão algumas evidências e detalhes dessas ações:\n1. Programas de Educação e Sensibilização Ambiental\nBraga desenvolve programas de educação ambiental nas escolas, com o objetivo de sensibilizar os jovens sobre as questões climáticas e a importância da sustentabilidade. Esses programas incluem atividades práticas, como oficinas de jardinagem e reciclagem, permitindo que crianças e adolescentes se tornem agentes ativos na promoção de práticas sustentáveis em suas comunidades. Um exemplo disto são as atividades desenvolvidas na Quinta Pedagógica de Braga e no seu recente Centro de Educação Ambiental onde mais de 100 atividades de educação às alterações climáticas pelas escolas do concelho. \n2. Incentivos Financeiros para Eficiência Energética\nO Município lançou iniciativas de apoio financeiro para a implementação de soluções de eficiência energética, como a instalação de painéis solares em habitações de baixo rendimento. Este programa oferece subsídios e condições favoráveis de financiamento, garantindo que famílias de todas as condições socioeconómicas possam beneficiar da transição para energias renováveis e reduzir seus custos energéticos. O Programa Municipal de Combate à Pobreza Energética de Braga que pretende oferecer obras de renovação de eficneica energética a famailais desfavorecidas é um exemplo disso. \n3. Acessibilidade à Mobilidade Sustentável\nBraga está a investir na expansão da rede de transportes públicos acessíveis e na promoção de alternativas de mobilidade sustentável, como a implementação de ciclovias e sistemas de partilha de bicicletas. A cidade desenvolveu um programa de bilhetes sociais que oferece tarifas reduzidas para cidadãos de baixa renda, garantindo que a mobilidade sustentável seja uma opção viável para todos. \n4. Projetos de Inclusão Social em Ações Climáticas\nO Município tem promovido projetos que combinam ação climática e inclusão social, como a criação de hortas comunitárias em áreas urbanas desfavorecidas. Esses espaços não apenas promovem a agricultura urbana e a biodiversidade, mas também criam oportunidades para a comunidade se envolver em práticas sustentáveis e fortalecer os laços sociais.\n5. Consulta e Participação da Comunidade\nO Município organiza consultas públicas e workshops para envolver os cidadãos na elaboração de políticas climáticas. Este processo garante que as preocupações e sugestões de todos os grupos, incluindo os mais vulneráveis, sejam consideradas nas decisões sobre investimentos em infraestrutura e projetos ambientais. O Pacto de Mobilidade Empresarial de Braga que estimula as empresas a contribuir para a mobilidade sustentável da cidade é um exemplo desta participação da comunidade por via do setor empresarial. \n7. Parcerias com Organizações Locais\nBraga colabora com organizações não governamentais e grupos comunitários para implementar iniciativas de inclusão e garantir que as ações climáticas cheguem a todos.
